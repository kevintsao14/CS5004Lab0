# Final Project: Texas Hold'em Starting Hand Evaluator 

## Description

This project develops a Texas Hold'em calculator designed to help beginners understand the basics of 
starting hand strategies in poker. The tool scores Texas Hold'em starting hands by analyzing 
properties such as card connectivity, suit uniformity, and value pairing, including high-value 
cards like Jacks through Aces. It also offers tailored advice based on the player's position at 
the poker table, helping users make informed decisions during the early, middle, and late stages of
a game.
